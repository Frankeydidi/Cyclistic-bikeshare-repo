# Cyclistic Bikeshare: Converting Casual Riders to Members (A Capstone Project)

This project is a case study I did using both Microsoft SQL Server and Power BI.
I carried out analysis on this case study to improve my skills as a data analyst and also as part of the requirements to obtain my Google Data Analytics Professional Certification.

## Introduction
The purpose of this report is to analyze and provide insights into the usage patterns and behaviors of Cyclistic bike riders, with specific focus on the differences between annual members and casual riders.
The analysis utilizes data from Cyclistic's bike sharing program and employs **Microsoft SQL Server** and **Power BI.**
The report seeks to address the following research questions:
- How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
- Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
- How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## The Data
The analysis relies on a comprehensive dataset obtained from the Cyclistic bike sharing program and encompasses various data points after data cleaning which include membership type, rideable type, start day, start month, and ride duration.
