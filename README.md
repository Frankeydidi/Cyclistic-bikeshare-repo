# Cyclistic Bikeshare: Converting Casual Riders to Members (A Capstone Project)

This project is a case study I did using both Microsoft SQL Server and Power BI.
I carried out analysis on this case study to improve my skills as a data analyst and also as part of the requirements to obtain my Google Data Analytics Professional Certification.

## Introduction
The purpose of this report is to analyze and provide insights into the usage patterns and behaviors of Cyclistic bike riders, with specific focus on the differences between annual members and casual riders.
The analysis utilizes data from Cyclistic's bike sharing program and employs **Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS)** and **Power BI.**
The report seeks to address the following research questions:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## The Data
The analysis relies on a comprehensive dataset obtained from the Cyclistic bike sharing program and encompasses various data points after data cleaning which include membership type, rideable type, start day, start month, and ride duration.
Spanning from January 2022 to December 2022, this dataset consists of 5,596,408 rides and offers a substantial timeframe for examining riders' behaviors and preferences.

The dataset forms the foundation of this report and is crucial to understanding the usage patterns and behaviors of Cyclistic bike riders.

## Data Preparation, Cleaning and Transfromation Process
Prior to analysis, the dataset was carefully curated and cleaned to ensure that the analysis is based on accurate and reliable data.
The downloaded dataset was imported into my local SSMS to enable me use SQL queries to carry out further inspection, cleaning and transformation.
After importing all the data, I utilized an SQL query to create a new table. The dataset from the 12 separate files was inserted into this table, preserving the original raw dataset for future reference.
Additionally, I conducted further data exploration, cleaning, and transformation by running additional queries. To review the step-by-step process in the correct order, please refer to the files available in the GitHub Project provided.
